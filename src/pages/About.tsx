              Céilí was created by Liam and James, two Irish lads who made the move to Australia and quickly
              realised how tough it can be to get set up when you first arrive in a new city.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we landed, there was no one place to find what you actually need — housing, cars, jobs,
              furniture, or even clubs and events to meet people. We found ourselves endlessly scrolling
              through different pages, chasing posts that were already snapped up or weeks out of date.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium text-foreground">It was a bit of a nightmare, to be honest.</p>
            <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">So we decided to build something better.</p>
            <p>
              Céilí brings everything together in one place, making it easier, quicker, and far less
              stressful to get yourself sorted in Melbourne. No more wasting time trawling through endless
              posts — just the things you need, when you need them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're looking for a place to live, a car to get around, a job to get started, or
              just a way to meet people and get involved, Céilí's here to help you settle in and get stuck
              into the good life.
            </p>
